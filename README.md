# UA+

UA+ (User agent plus) is a different type of reset style sheet. Instead of mostly resetting and normalizing properties, we focus on improving existing user agent styles and adding new styles only where browsers fall short.

Please note that this project is still in the early alpha phase. Feedback is highly appreciated.

## Who is this for?

UAplus is for anyone who wants a better baseline for their style sheets. It does more than other reset style sheets but less than most. Most importantly, we try not to be too opinionated and reset too much. We also take accessibility more into consideration than many others.

Visit our demo pages to compare your browsers' default styles with our improved ones. Please note that the differences are often barely noticeable. That's because we like the default styles and only help out browsers where needed.
